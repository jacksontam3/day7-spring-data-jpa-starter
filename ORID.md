ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]

We learn about the JAVA Spring Boot framework with JPA Database design today, this activity help me understand why we need to seperate

service layer, repository layer, and controller layer and how JPA can facilitate the development process by simplify input.

Relection: Interesting

Interpretive: 

Have a breify understanding about the JPA DB design concept and create actual use case of it. 
It is fun but also challenging to ctach up with the content.
Luckily with the help of my teammate I can keep up with content so far.

Decisional: 
I will review the content of the lectures and adopt JPA design pattern in my future works. As backend design is also the main job of my team.

As a new joiner to the company as I only join the team for one month, I will try to keep up with the training flow and learn as much as I can.
